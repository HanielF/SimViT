# SimViT: Exploring a Simple Vision Transformer with sliding windows

Our classification code is developed on top of [pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models), [deit](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit) and [PVT](https://github.com/whai362/PVT).

We will open our models soon.
